			The Blue Magic Expansion expands on the usage of the NPC Guilds in game.<br>
			NPC Guilds operate independently of the Player Guild system allowing a player to join both. In order to join an NPC Guild you find the desired guild master and say his or her name along with the word join. It costs a tiny 500gp to join an NPC Guild and other than the exception of the Thieves guild there are no prerequisites. In order you change your NPC guild you'll have to find a guildmaster for the guild you're in and state his or her name along with the word resign or quit. It's that easy.<br>
			<br>
			So if it's that easy why use it? Well, once you join an NPC Guild you cannot change you're guild for a week. This presents an either/or choice in which benefit you want to use and the ability to semi-freely swap between them. In a way it limits you, but it doesn't impose the penalty of wrong choice though out your character's lifespan of use.<br>
