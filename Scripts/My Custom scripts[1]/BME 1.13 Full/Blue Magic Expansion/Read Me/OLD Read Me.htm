			<font size='5'><b>Blue Magic</b></font>
			<ul>
				If you have never played Final Fantasy then I'm sure you have no clue 
				what Blue Magic is but you have seen it's system before. Blue Magic is 
				the ability to permanently learn a spell or effect a monster uses. While 
				the system to learn changes, FFVI it was attack the monster, FFXIII it 
				was use an item, FFIV it was eat the monster, and so on. FFV in which it 
				debuted and several other FF games it is based on getting hit with the 
				attack and surviving. I have done this for UO.<br>
				<br>
				Blue Magic's spells are not just about damage. Many are utility, status, 
				or just plain operate outside the normal principles spells use. Be sure 
				to check the gimmicks attached to each.<br>
				<br>
				Blue Magic in its default set up works kinda like a class system many 
				shards use. If you cast a Blue Spell and you have over 50.0 (excluding 
				items) in another spellcasting or taming skill. The idea for this lock 
				is based off synergy limitation. It simply takes less skills and stats 
				to be a spellcaster allowing more combinations than a combat specialist. 
				Rather than out right blocking the combinations I went with limiting 
				their ability to hit GM in those skills. Also it forces the intent 
				that you should pick up 30.0 in magery and use that system for recalling 
				instead of creating another recall rip off.<br>
				<br>
				Many words are <i>italicized</i>, mouse over them if you want an 
				explanation.<br>
			</ul>
		</ul>
		<hr>
		<ul>
			<font size='5'><b>General Features</b></font>
			<ul>
				<br>
				<b>Minimal edits to RunUO's files</b><br>
				The only absolutely required edit is done to Scripts\Misc\AOS assuming 
				you've patched up to handle SA support. This edit allows programmers to 
				patch into the various enhancement properties AOS, SE, ML, and SA have 
				added without having to equip a made up item into the Unsed_F slots, 
				which may at any point be put into use by OSI anyway.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Seperate Save File</b><br>
				Installing, updating, removing, is pretty easy. Blue Magic creates and 
				maintains it's own separate save file that tracks who is a blue mage and 
				what spells do they know. The only stuff saved in game is the additional 
				items, mobiles, and some spawners (which can be removed with a single 
				command). No edits have to be made to BaseSpell, Regents, or anything 
				of the like.<br>
				<br>
				<b>30 New Spells</b> (and growing)<br>
				Cleric & Druid sport less than 10 and each has been around for 4 years.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Several New Monsters</b><br>
				Some of the monsters have their own cool traits.<br>
				<br>
				<b>New Quests</b><br>
				Various quests have been added for blue mages. Not a blue mage? No 
				problem, a few are slayer type and open for others to participate in for 
				rewards.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Status System</b><br>
				The status system is no longer required for use but to me it's effects are superior than to the alternative use of enhancement properties. should you take the time to install it, make the system true and several spell effects will adapt and use it.<br>

			<font size='5'><b>Quests</b></font>
			<ul>
				<br>
				<b>Blue Ben</b><br>
				Is the quest offerer for all blue mage quests.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Blue Mage Training Quest</b><br>
				Available only if your Forensics skill is below 51.0 (allowing a 50.0 start out)<br>
				It is a skill training quest, reward is the same as EvaInt's (ring of the savant)<br>
				<br>
				<b>An Empty Vessel</b><br>
				Only offered if you have more than 51.0 in Forensics.<br>
				Not exactly a quest. It is a series of questions asked by Ben.<br>
				Upon completion of the questions you are offered the Blue Mage Serpent Quest.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Blue Mage Serpent Quest</b><br>
				Your answers to An Empty Vessel determine which place you must search for your mark.<br>
				Your mark is a land tile (or there of) that blends in with all other land tiles.<br>
				Only Staff and the player can see it, others walk through and cannot making it the first 
				ever instance item in UO.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Blue Touched</b>
				<ul>
					Blue Clothing is a special kind of clothing, it comes with Resist All 
					+5 and is blessed. The garment has been Touched by the Azurian forces 
					to be adaptable and enchantable. There are nine different 
					enhancements, Insight, Haste, Arcane, Skill, Mighty, Nimble, 
					Intelligent, Regeneration, and Resistance. Each quest below rewards 
					the items and enhancements.<br>
					<br>
					<b>Blue Mage Tier One Slayer Quest</b><br>
					Kill a few drakes, gazers, lichs, and daemons for a random blue 
					clothing reward.<br>
					<br>
					<b>Blue Mage Tier Two Slayer Quest</b><br>
					Kill a few dragons, elder gazers, lich lords, and ice fiends for a 
					random enchantment deed.<br>
					<br>
					<b>Blue Mage Tier Three Slayer Quest</b><br>
					Kill a few shadow wyrms, beholders, ancient lichs, and balrons for a 
					random powerful enchantment deed.<br>
					<b>Limits Surpassed</b><br>
					8 items & 9 enhancements right? Not so much. The 9th item, the 
					necklace, can only be enhanced by a special enhancement that cannot 
					be applied to the rest of the clothing.
				</ul>
				<b>Finding Quina</b><br>
				You require this quest to enter the area where Quina spawns and complete 
				it upon killing him. There is no kick out timer or anything so you may 
				farm him but leaving will prevent reentry for a few days.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Last Move</b><br>
				If you have learned all the moves of blue magic you can try a boss fight. Invite your friends and fight for a chance for an artifact.
				<b>Last Spell</b><br>
				Same concept as above but for spells. Not finished.<br>
				<b>You are pretty good</b><br>
				The last one in the line of boss fights. Haven't started on.<br>
				<br>
			</ul>
		</ul>
		<hr>
		<ul>
			<font size='5'><b>Items</b></font>
			<ul>
				<br>
				<b>Blue Mage Clothing</b><br>
				The magic binding this clothing into creation is very delicate. Someone 
				untrained in it's use (ie not a blue mage) will unravel it destroying 
				the clothing and all of it's enhancements.
				<br>
				<b>Forks!</b><br>
				Like Quina, many blue mages have found a war fork perfectly suited to their combat style. these forks use Wrestling and do not prohibit use of combat maneuvers.<br>
				<b>Silver</b>: Undead slayer.<br>
				<b>Bistro</b>: Imposes a -15% fire resistance penalty on hit.<br>
				<b>Gastro</b>: The animation changes on each swing, each type has it's own bonus.<br>
				<b>Needle</b>: A special fork, exceptional against certain monsters whom may be required by the blue touched quests.<br>
