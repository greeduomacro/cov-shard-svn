			<div align="center">In order to become a Blue Mage you'll need to speak with Ben.<br>
			<img src="images/Ben.png"><br>
			<i>he looks like this</i></div>
			<br>
			If you have less than 50.0 Forensics he'll off a New Haven style go train it quest. 
			However, the reward for training Forensics is 51.0 rather than 50.0 like most other 
			training quests. This allows you to start at 50.0 and still obtain the reward. Which 
			is the Ring Of The Savant (some one the eval trainer gives) which is a Blessed ring 
			with FC/FCR 1 & +3 int.<br>
			<br>
			You'll also need Magic Resistance. Forensics & Magic Resist work together like 
			Magery & Eval Int or Necromancy & Spirit Speak. Also, there are Special Moves that 
			can be learned. Much like Double Strike or even Bushido's Lightning Strike. In order 
			you use those you'll have to be unarmed, Tactics & Wrestling would be required for 
			those since otherwise without them you couldn't hit. More on this later.<br>
			<br>
			If you have more than 50.0 Forensics Ben will send a menu saying this<br>
			<i>Hello, my name is Ben and I am one of the Masters of Blue Magic. In order to 
			become a blue mage, you must have at least 50 in forensics and you are required to 
			train magic resist if you wish to be worth your weight. There are over twenty spells 
			for you to learn as a blue mage, each one is unique and their effects widely very 
			unlike any spell you have seen before.They can be learned throughout Ilshenar by 
			interacting with various "special" monsters. Some spells are learned by being subject 
			to their effects, while others can only be learned by studying the remains of the very 
			special creatures (by using the "[bm study" and targeting the corpse). Lastly, for 
			you types that like to get your hands dirty, there are a few moves that can be learned 
			as well.<br>
			<br>
			If this appeals to you, I'd like to ask you a series of questions in order understand 
			the nature of your soul. Thereby I will be able to tell you which mark is required for 
			you to become a blue mage. Mindful this is a life style and not just a quick pick me 
			up. <FONT COLOR='#AA0000'>Becoming a blue mage will severely inhibit your ability to 
			be a master mage in any other spellcasting ability.</FONT></i><br>
			<br>
			When you click ok you'll be asked a series of questions, depending on your answer you'll 
			be sent to find one of four objects.<br>
			<dd>Sky: Located in Req Volom, minor run but you'll have to deal with spiders and evil mages.</dd><br>
			<dd>Flame: Located in the Volcano, short run but dragonic spawn and you'll need Teleport.</dd><br>
			<dd>Gale: Located in one in the Kirin Passage, western side with the largest cavern, kind of dangerous.</dd><br>
			<dd>Spring: Located on the bridge between Compassion and Spirituality. Easiest to obtain.</dd><br>
			<dd>Stone: Located in the Rock Dungeon, longest run but tends to be the safest.</dd><br>
			Only your Blue Mage can see the item and simply running up to it will cause it to pop into your 
			pack. Once you have it you need to mark it as a quest item (like any mondain's obtain quest) 
			click on your self to display your context menu and click on Toggle Quest Item, then target the 
			scroll. Then talk to Ben. You'll be given one last chance to confirm this is what you want.<br>
			<br>
			<b><font size="+2">Skill Lock</font></b><br>
			Blue Mage operates almost if it were a class and has strict requirements. At no time are you 
			allowed to have more than 50.0 as your base skill value in Magery, Necromancy, Chiveraly, 
			Spellweaving, Mysticism, or Taming related skills. You are allowed (and encouraged) to use 
			items to increase your relative skill, such as a Tome of Lost Knowledge. Should your base 
			skill be higher than 50.0 upon joining or casting a spell it will be lowered.<br>
			<br>
			Ultimately this greatly effects which items you'll wear. Magery increasing rings and 
			bracelets for instance are a must if you plan to use Mark & Recall. Draconic or 
			legendary pets cannot be used but though Bushido you can obtain and use a Lesser Hiryu, 
			you'll just have a limitation on your Vet skills preventing you from properly healing it.<br>
			<br>
			By intent, you cannot have it all and with the abundance of pokemon style shards, you're 
			debuffs combined with a super pet are simply too powerful for a single player.
