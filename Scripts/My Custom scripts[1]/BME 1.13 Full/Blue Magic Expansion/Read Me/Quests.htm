			BME adds a couple quests to the game. Here is a list of the currently offered ones.<br>
			<br>
			<b>Blue Magic Training</b><br>
			This quest is just for training up to 50.0 in Forensics, see Become A Blue Mage for details.<br>
			<br>
			<b>Empty Vessel</b><br>
			This quest is how you become a Blue Mage, the questions and theme come from Final Fantasy 
			Online it's self, see Become A Blue Mage for details.<br>
			<br>
			<b>Blue Touched</b><br>
			Blue Touched Clothing is a special craftable that uses three different quests to obtain 
			the ingredents. There are 7 types of clothing and each can have any two combintions of nine 
			different enhancements, meaning there are 81 possible combinations for each piece.<br>
			<br>
			<ul>
				<b>Tier One Slayer</b> gives a random piece of Blue Clothing, they are Blessed, have 5% 
				resistance in all elements, and since they are clothing they cannot be broken. They can 
				be enhanced with the other slayer quests but a piece of clothing can only have a single 
				deed per level. for each deed the clothing also gains +100 luck, up to 1,400 for a full 
				suit! (excluding the necklace)<br>
				<br>
				<b>Tier Two Slayer</b> gives you a deed that may be used to enhance your Blue Clothing. 
				There are nine different types of deeds that give a different set of properties each. 
				Mindful, using the same level of deed will replace the last one used on your clothing.<br>
				<br>
				<b>Tier Three Slayer</b> gives a "powerful" version of the Tier Two Slayer, it fundamentally 
				works exactly like the none powerful version, but can be stacked with them. For instance, 
				a "Mighty" & "Powerful Regenerate" can be used on the same piece of clothing for the 
				"Mighty Regeneration" enhancement. Matching combination may be used as well, such as two 
				"Haste" become a "Quicksilver".<br>
				<br>
				<b>The Necklace</b> supported in the scripts but currently unreleased is the 8th Blue Touched 
				item. It can only be upgraded using the 10th enhancement deed; Efficient. Fully upgraded the 
				Necklace will give +5% Resist All, Lower Mana cost 30%, and +200 Luck.
			</ul>
			<br>
			<b>Trapped Pixe</b><br>
			An escort style quest found in level 3 of the new Cave Dungeon. She has the same stats as a 
			pixie but cannot be commanded. Upon leading her out of the cave stand at the entrace until 
			she vanishes.<br>
			<br>
			<b>Finding Quina</b><br>
			Offered by Quale in the Serpentine Passage. While on this quest you are able to step though 
			the teleporter at the northeast end of Monitor. Quina can be found down there and he wants 
			to fight. You can learn Frog Drop from Quina easily enough but he offers special items. You 
			may even stick around to farm him and a nearby cave has some frogs. The older they are (up 
			to 7 days) the more likely they are to drop an item Frog Drop uses (see the spell for details). 
			the quest it's self can only be repeated once per week so once you leave your gone for awhile, 
			just to give someone else a fair chance.<br>
			<br>
			Here the details on the items.
			<dd><b>Needle Fork:</b> Is considered a "slayer" for monsters on the Blue Touched hunting list.</dd><br>
			<dd><b>Silver Fork:</b> Has the Undead Slayer and is a bit more powerful that a normal Warfork.</dd><br>
			<dd><b>Bistro Fork:</b> Is even stronger, and it delivers a speical -10 penalty to Fire Resist to opponents it hits.</dd><br>
			<dd><b>Gastro Fork:</b> The strongest fork, the different swing animations mean increased accuracy, speed, or damage!</dd><br>
			<dd><b>Upgrade Spork Deed:</b> Upgrades one of the above forks. Each fork can only be upgraded once.</dd><br>
			<dd><b>Angel's Snack:</b> A special type of grass a Blue Mage can learn the spell Angel's Snack from, can be used for deco afterwards!</dd><br>
			<dd><b>Frog Drop Bag:</b> A special Blessed bag that you can put Frog Drop items in saving you the insurance costs.</dd><br>
			<br>
			<b>Turkey Hunting</b><br>
			Less of a quest and more of a mini-champion. By killing turkeys again and again you'll force their 
			brethern to seek vengence. Only one person can actively be hunting them or else it is impossible to 
			finish the spawn level.<br>
			<br>
			<b>Malboro's Scales</b><br>
			A simple slayer quest, kill 10 Malboros to learn the Bad Breath spell.<br>
			<br>
