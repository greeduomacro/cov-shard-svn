			It's not all about the new Blue Mage in this expansion. A couple new additions made it's way 
			in here, some of them are pretty impressive too.<br>
			<br>
			<b>Monk</b> (<a href='SubSystems_Monk.htm'>more details here</a>, note haven't updated that section yet)<br>
			This seemingly simple pair of gloves is rather complex. When donned they take up your hands 
			and glove layers. They can be single clicked for one of four different property sets and can 
			be double clicked for a special menu to select one of six different strike types. Depending 
			and the order and choice of strikes used, a special finisher move will appear. You can also 
			use a special enhanced regeneration move with a 3 minute cool down.<br>
			<br>
			The gloves are obtained at level 1, and can be enhanced as far as the 5th level. Each level 
			increases the base damage of the gloves as well as improving the strike damage and stances.
			At the 5th level the gloves even change art style. The exact method to obtain them or 
			upgrade them has yet to be done by me.<br>
			<br>
			The menu has to bars shown in it. the more Light or Dark attacks to use the more those bars 
			fill up. Once filled the bars are replaced by two special buttons. You need not use them 
			immediately and they will not interrupt your combo for using them.And lastly, the button to 
			the upper right can be used to enter a special monk meditive state. Upon entering you'll lose 
			your mana but regain 20HP per second, if you du not interrupt this trance you'll regen your 
			previsouly mana (plus bonuses) back, but if you do it's possible to lose mana for using this.<br>
			<br>
			Also, there are some other Monk related items, unlike Blue Clothing anyone can wear them.<br>
			<ul>
				<b>Jidz Tetka:</b>Has Attack Chance +50%, also improves your stance level by one.<br>
				<b>Monk's Belt:</b>Has Defend Chance +50%, also your Breath Of Fire Finisher deals double damage.<br>
				<b>Dragonscale Chest:</b>Has Resist All +25% & +50HP, can only be worn by vetern players (3rd level+).<br>
			</ul>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<b>Assassin</b> (<a href='SubSystems_Assassin.htm'>more details here</a>)<br>
			A number of small and quick theif/assassin type quests were added. Most missions would have 
			you obtain an item from an NPc (by stealing) or from their house (may require lockpicking). 
			The NPCs and guards are quick to respond making Stealth a requirement. Assassion quests 
			require you to sneak in and kill your target then sneak out. Being discovered fails the quest.<br>
			<br>
			As an Assassin you also gain the benefit of being able to use Armor Ignore, Bleed Attack, Mortal 
			Strike, & Shadow Strike no matter what weapon you are using. In addition you can use a special 
			Assassinate move, which deals a large amount of damage to a unknowing target at full health. 
			Otherwise it works much like Lightning Strike, including the chance of a Critical Strike.
			<br>
			<br>
			Quest rewards are Florins, a type of currancy which you can spend to buy Assassin Garbs. All 
			gear cannot be used unless you are in the Thieves Guild, there are 11 in all. All gear have 
			the following properties: <i>+15 HP, Regen Hits/Mana 1, +5 Str, +3 Dex, +2% Attack/Defend, 
			+2% Swing Speed, & +5% Damage.</i> And together they give a lot of Hit Points. Additionally 
			each item can be upgrade and/or have additional traits.<br>
			<ul>
				<b>Altair's Sword:</b> +50% damage for attacking the backside of a creature.<br>
				<b>Thigh Boots:</b> Nothing (at this time).<br>
				<b>Studded Chest:</b> Upgrade, gains Reflect Physical 15%.<br>
				<b>Skirt:</b> Upgradable, gains Lower Mana Cost 15%.<br>
				<b>Shirt:</b> Upgradable, gains Enhance Potions 25%.<br>
				<b>Mempo:</b> Upgradable, gains Lower Mana Cost 10%.<br>
				<b>Gloves:</b> Upgradable, gains Reflect Physical 10%.<br>
				<b>Kilt:</b> Upgradable, gains Lower Mana Cost 15%.<br>
				<b>Jin Bori:</b> Can be loaded with (poisoned) daggers and used to throw them.<br>
				<b>Chain Coif:</b> Nothing (at this time).<br>
				<b>Bone Arms:</b> While worn, Altair's Sword get's a bonus to damage if the target is at 10% health or lower.<br>
				<b>Belt:</b> Can be loaded with Heal Potions, this lets you use a second delay system for drinking heals.<br>
