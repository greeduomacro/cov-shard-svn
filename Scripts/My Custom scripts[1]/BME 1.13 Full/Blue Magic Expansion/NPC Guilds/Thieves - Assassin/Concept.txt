
Skill Set (700.0)
	100:	Snooping (to validate whom to kill by seeing if they have X on them)
	100:	Stealing (60.0+ for guild membership)
	200:	Hiding + Stealth (for sneaking)
	200:	Tactics + Weapon Skill (for combat)
	100:	Lockpicking (to open custom locked doors)
ACreedGuards
	Say ! in grey on 1st notice. Yellow on second, Red on 3rd, attack on 4th.
	Killable and attacking them doesn't make you a criminal (for sake of town guards).
	Can call for back up.
	Patrols on certain routes (if not summoned via quest NPCs)
	AlwaysAttackable must be true on all ACReed NPCs
Criminal
	Stealing from AlwaysAttackable NPCs seems 100% none-criminal action.
	Being marked Criminal in town isn't auto kill you as vendor's don't call guards on you.
	Being marked Criminal prevents you from calling guards.
	Once an NPC damages a criminal, losing crim status still prevents you from calling guards from that NPC.
	Thus On Guard Notice you can be set criminal.
	As long as Quest NPCs call ACreedGuards not normal Guards that's fine too.
